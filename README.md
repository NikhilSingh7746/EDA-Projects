# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects Overview

## 🔍 What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the initial step in data analysis that helps you understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in your dataset. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of data, often using visual methods, before applying formal modeling or machine learning.

## 🧠 Objectives of EDA

- Gain insights from raw data
- Identify trends, outliers, and correlations
- Test assumptions and validate hypotheses
- Guide feature engineering and model building

## ⚙️ Typical EDA Techniques

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**: Histograms, bar plots, scatter plots
- **Correlation & Distribution Analysis**: Heatmaps, box plots
- **Grouping & Aggregation**: Using groupby operations for segment analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` – For data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` – For visualization
- `Jupyter Notebook` – For interactive analysis and documentation

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project includes:
- Dataset used (CSV or Excel format)
- Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step EDA
- Visuals and plots for interpretation
- Key takeaways and business insights
